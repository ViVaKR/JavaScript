# Algorithm

- Time complexity : Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a funciton of input size.
- Space complexity : Amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size

1. Big-O Notation (O-notation) - Worst case complexity
2. Omega Notation () - Best case complexity
3. Theta Notation : Average case complexity

## Big-O Notation

1. Time complexity
    - O(n) - Liner
    - O($n^2$) - Quadratic
    - O($n^3) - Cubic
    - O(logn) - Logarithmic
2. Space complexity
   - O(1) - Constant
   - O(n) - Linear
   - O(logn) - Logarithmic
